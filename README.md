# RADAR-Robust-DRL-based-Resource-Allocation-Against-Adversarial-Attacks-in-Intelligent-O-RAN
RADAR is a DRL-based resource allocation mechanism for O-RAN, defending against adversarial attacks. It enhances resilience through input space sanitization, augmentation, and adversarial training. RADAR significantly recovers user data rates across eMBB, mMTC, and uRLLC slices.
